# TT Norms font files

Place your TT Norms web font files here so the site matches the logo:

- **TTNorms-Light.woff2** (weight 300)
- **TTNorms-Regular.woff2** (weight 400)
- **TTNorms-Bold.woff2** (weight 700)

If your files have different names (e.g. `TTNormsPro-Light.woff2`), rename them to the above or update the `@font-face` paths in `src/app/globals.css`.

You can get TT Norms from [TypeType](https://typetype.org/fonts/tt-norms-pro/) (license required) or export WOFF2 from your design tool if you have a desktop license.
